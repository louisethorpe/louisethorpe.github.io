# This was cool. 

I've been pretty into climbing for 5 or so years, mostly bouldering, but a bit of roped climbing from time to time. About a year ago, a friend of mine told me a work colleague of his could teach us to lead trad and I was keen to give this a go. Trad is spooky, but maybe my favourite style of outdoor climbing even though I've not done much of it. 

After a solid day of learning good gear placements and building anchors, we got doing some proper leading and I got up a few pretty good climbs including **April Crack (HS 4b)**.
