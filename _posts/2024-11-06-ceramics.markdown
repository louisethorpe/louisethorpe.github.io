# My most recent side quest

At the beginning of 2023, I realised I was working pretty hardcore in tech and lacked some creative output. Luckily for me, a friend of mine owns a pottery studio and is a fantastic teacher. I went alongt o a few classes here and there and quickly became addicted.

I ended up getting very integrated into the studio, befriending other members and getting myself my own tools and bits. Eventually, I started assisting with classes (I was thoroughly underskilled for this) and helping out at the studio by loading kilns and setting up for classes. My skills skyrocketed! Boom, then I started teaching and, once again, my skills improved like crazy!

So, here's an intro to me as a ceramicist, what I make, what I teach, what I get from pots!
