# A tap shoe, but make it electronic

A good project I worked on a couple years ago was my Electronic Tap Shoe. I have been an avid dancer from a young age so when I started learning how to process digital signals and add audio effects, I immediately thought about how I could combo up my dance and technical skills.

I did some preliminary projects processing wavetable inputs to replicate a certain filters and trigger audio given certain sensor states to get familar with the Bela platform and figure out what sensors could work with the idea. I settled on using standard FSRs for triggering the audio and bought the cheapest pair of trainers from Sainsbury's that I could find.
