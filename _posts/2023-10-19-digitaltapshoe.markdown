# A tap shoe, but make it electronic

A good project I worked on a couple years ago was my Electronic Tap Shoe. I have been an avid dancer from a young age so when I started learning how to process digital signals and add audio effects, I immediately thought about how I could combo up my dance and technical skills.

I did some preliminary projects processing wavetable inputs to add audio filters and trigger audio given certain sensor states to get familar with the Bela platform and figure out what sensors could work with the idea. I settled on using standard FSRs for triggering the audio and bought the cheapest pair of trainers from Sainsbury's that I could find.

**Note:** this project was done during COVID so a big shoutout to my dad for teaching me how to solder in my parents dining room.

I ended up placing five sensors across the two shoes. One on each toe, one on each heel and one on the ball of the right foot (see picture below). I left the left without a corresponding sensor on the bottom of the shoe so that I could stand comfortably without triggering any sound.

Ok, so all the sensors are in place. Up next: **audio!**
