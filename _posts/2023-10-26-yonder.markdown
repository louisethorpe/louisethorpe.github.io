# The Great Indoors

Amongst many of my technical projects, I've als been working part time at Yonder Climbing Centre for two years. This started as a side thing while I was working on my master's degree, but the pace and people quickly became part of my everyday life. 

*This is not an ad for Yonder, but I do highly recommend the place.*

# What do I do at Yonder?

Currently, I work behind the desk checking people in for climbs and doing a numch of cleaning. It's a climbing gym, it gets chalky. It's not always the most exciting job, but I do love the socialising that comes with the role.
