# Introduction

Back in 2022, I finished up my master's degree and completed my dissertation project looking at the relationship between shape and sound. This was a side project to larger work being undertaken by Sebastian LÃ¶bbers - you can find his research [here](https://sebastianlobbers.com/). 

As part of my work, I used data collected by Sebastian to train a multi-class classifier to classify six categories of shapes to a corresponding sound descriptor and I was pretty happy with how the final results came out. Below is a confusion matrix showing the ground truth labelling against the predicted labelling.

Ok, so the confusion matrix looks a little bit messy - but you'll understand my reasoning for being happy with these results after I've explained my thinking.

# The Data

As I was using data collected from a small study, there wasn't much of it. BUT luckily, the sketches collected were stored in the same format of those in the [Quick, Draw!](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) dataset by Google meaning I could make use of the machine learning technique transfer learning.
