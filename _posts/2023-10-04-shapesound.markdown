Back in 2022, I finished up my master's degree and completed my dissertation project looking at the relationship between shape and sound. This was a side project to larger work being undertaken by Sebastian LÃ¶bbers - you can find his research [here](https://sebastianlobbers.com/). 

As part of my work, I used data collected by Sebastian to train a multi-class classifier to classify six categories of shapes to a corresponding sound descriptor and I was pretty happy with how the final results came out. Below is a confusion matrix showing the ground truth labelling against the predicted labelling.
